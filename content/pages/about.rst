What is Banski?
================

Literally, it is a Lojban predicate word which means "to-language-explain". In this context, it is meant to denote expositions to do with language. Ultimately, this is indeed a venue for Lojban enthusiasts to explore ideas about linguistics, logic and language philosophy. For many of us, Lojban is a boundless source of curiosity in those fields but also unto itself.

The content herein is what the authors contribute to it. However, the aim is topical exposition that duly extends beyond the meager remark and attempts to reveal or otherwise engage some line of thinking on the formalism, philosophy or culture that constitutes Lojban as we know it, or as we envision it.


Who are the authors?
====================

They are certainly Lojbanists who have taken the time to explore these topics to the point that bears repeating! And have the fortitude to see the thought consumated for the benefit of the rest of us. That is to say, it is less useful to characterize our authors than to venerate the kinds of contributions that they make. And the fruits of concerted and oriented efforts to extend our reasoning of Lojban will always be welcome.

How do I contribute?
====================

This site is statically generated from source that is available at http://github.com/banski/banski.github.io Its important to be familiar with the utility `Git <https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/>`_. By "forking" the `banski.github.io` repository, you can make your own changes to the site (such as creating a new article). Then you can through the Github website submit a pull-request asking the other contributors to Banski to review your contributions. If nothing is wrong with your submission it will be merged and appear `on the site <http://banski.github.io>`_.

Beyond using Git, the actual system used for generating the site is `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_. Its a nice Python static site generator in that it makes it very easy to actually build the site and try it out locally. This will let you review your changes just as they'll appear once accepted.

Eventually a review of this whole process will be made, but until then - just ask around.
