What is Banski?
================

Literally, it is a Lojban predicate word which means "to-language-explain". In this context, it is meant to denote expositions to do with language. Ultimately, this is indeed a venue for Lojban enthusiasts to explore ideas about linguistics, logic and language philosophy. For many of us, Lojban is a boundless source of curiosity in those fields but also unto itself.

The content herein is what the authors contribute to it. However, the aim is topical exposition that duly extends beyond the meager remark and attempts to reveal or otherwise engage some line of thinking on the formalism, philosophy or culture that constitutes Lojban as we know it, or as we envision it.


Who are the authors?
====================

They are certainly Lojbanists who have taken the time to explore these topics to the point that deserves expatiation! And have the fortitude to see the thought consumated for the benefit of the rest of us. That is to say, it is less useful to characterize our authors than to venerate the kinds of contributions that they make. And the fruits of concerted and oriented efforts to extend our understanding of Lojban will always be welcome.

How do I contribute?
====================

If you'd like to contribute directly, you'll need to be familiar with the goings-ons of open-source. Specifically, how to use `Git <https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/>`_ to fork repositories and submit pull requests. Additionally, the site is built with a nice Python static site generator `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_. You'll have to get familiar with it if you want to build the site locally to see how your changes will look before submitting them for review.

If none of that is your cup of tea, you can always reach out to an existing author for help getting your contribution formatted and submitted once you have authored it. 

**At minimum your article will need to be formatted as a** `ReStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`_ **document.**
